                    <p>The Booksitters is the online bookstore for buying new books and used books at lowest prices with free shipping across India. We personally assess each and every book to ensure you get the best quality and value for money.
                        Filled with gems to discover, packed away in one of the forgotten corners of Purani Dilli lies the dream of every booklover— The Sunday Book Market. At prices that go as low as the cost of a packet of chips are rare old books to find, with some used ones, and those recent in print. It is here that you end up crossing paths with a book that you thought you’d never read, but the price being too tempting to pass on, you end up buying it. And when you finally get to reading it, you discover that it is the story you had been looking for all along. ut not everyone gets to experience that magic and joy. Who knows, maybe you’ve never been to Delhi in the first place. As such, geography, time and a series of other unfortunate events can come in the way of running into that one and many perfect books which could be life-changing, which could be just what you need.

                        Bookish Santa began with the vision of never letting anyone miss out on that experience. We want you to find new worlds to escape into and new ideas to chase. We want to help you find the right book, and more importantly, we want to be your personal Sunday Book Market.  </p>
